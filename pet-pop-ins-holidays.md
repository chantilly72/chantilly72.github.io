# Pet Pop-ins & Holidays

## £12 to include 2 daily visits

### £7 for 1 visit

Each visit is around 30 minutes. Pets fed, let in/out, fuss and play etc.

I am also happy to switch lights on/off, open/close curtains, water plants etc.

This is ideal if your pet just needs a lunchtime break, if you are out for the day/night, away for a couple of days or a longer period of time.

Extra may be charged for multiple pets.
