# Dog Walking
## £8 (approx 45mins)
### Additional dogs from same household + £3

All dogs are walked from their home on a one-to-one basis unless otherwise agreed.
This guarantees each dog 100% attention and fuss!!

Older dogs and little legs may need less than 45mins – that’s fine – as are longer walks for those with boundless energy!
